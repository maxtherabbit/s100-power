# s100-power
PCB for S100 Power Supply which fits both original Altair and Clone cabinets

Based on circuit designed by Gifford Toole. Provides 10A (with Hammond 167S12) or 20A (with Hammond 167V12) total current. Mounting provisions for both original Altair cabinet as well as clone cabniet designed by Mike Douglas.
My clone cabinet was purchased from https://adwaterandstir.com/ in 2024 and uses M4 hardware. The original one sold by Mike might use 8-32 instead. Make sure you check this before ordering the standoffs!
For the one using M4, I included appropriate length standoffs in the BOM. The M4 ones attach to the screws which connect the rear panel to the bottom panel. Get longer M4 screws and thread them into the existing welded screw bosses from the bottom, then attach standoffs to them. Affix the longer 4-40 standoffs to the front of the PCB with 4-40 screws, then bolt PCB to M4 standoffs with the original M4 screws which came with the cabniet.

I found that the Hammond 167S12 transformer fit the two pre-drilled holes in the rear panel, on the right side. You will need to drill two additional holes above the pre-drilled ones at the same width apart to secure the transformer properly.
